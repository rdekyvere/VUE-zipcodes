AJAX to External API

This little Vue.js app is using AJAX to call an external API and update the data live to the user.

I use Axios to call the external API which looks up a zip code and finds the corresponding city and state.

I'm making use of U.S. addresses because the API is free to use without limitations. There is a Dutch version but you need to register and that comes with monthly costs.
